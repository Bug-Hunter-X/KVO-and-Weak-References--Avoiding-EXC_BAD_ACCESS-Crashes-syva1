In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, particularly when dealing with weak references.  If an observer is added to an object using a weak reference and that object is deallocated before the observer is removed, a crash can occur. This is because the observer will try to access the deallocated object, leading to an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  The problem is subtle because the weak reference itself is valid â€“ it's simply pointing to memory that no longer contains a valid object.
